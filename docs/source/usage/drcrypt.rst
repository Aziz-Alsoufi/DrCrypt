Bcrypt Password Hashing and Verification
=====================================================

Introduction
------------

Welcome to this in-depth guide where we'll explore secure password hashing and verification using the Bcrypt algorithm provided by the `drcrypt` library. Bcrypt is a widely recommended cryptographic hash function for securely storing passwords.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before we dive into the world of secure password handling, make sure you have the `drcrypt` library installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install drcrypt

Understanding the Code
----------------------

Let's delve deep into the code snippet you provided and explore each step of secure password hashing and verification:

1. **Importing the Bcrypt Class:**

   We start our journey by importing the `Bcrypt` class from the `drcrypt.hash` module. This class provides us with the tools needed for secure password hashing and verification:

   .. code-block:: python

      from drcrypt.hash import Bcrypt

2. **Creating an Instance of Bcrypt:**

   The adventure begins with the creation of an instance of the `Bcrypt` class:

   .. code-block:: python

      bcrypt_hasher = Bcrypt()

   This instance will be our trusted guide throughout our journey.

3. **Hashing a Password and Generating a Salt:**

   We embark on the first step of our journey by defining a sample password: `"mysecretpassword"`. Using the `bcrypt_hasher`, we generate a unique salt and use it to hash the password:

   .. code-block:: python

      password = "mysecretpassword"
      salt = bcrypt_hasher.generate_salt()
      hashed_password = bcrypt_hasher.bcrypt_hash(password, salt)

   The `hashed_password` now contains the secure hash of the password.

4. **Verifying an Entered Password:**

   As we continue our journey, we define an input password for verification: `"mysecretpassword"`. We utilize the `bcrypt_hasher` to compare the input password with the previously hashed password:

   .. code-block:: python

      input_password = "mysecretpassword"
      if bcrypt_hasher.verify_password(input_password, hashed_password):
          print("Password Matched!")
      else:
          print("Password Does Not Match!")

Conclusion
-----------

In this in-depth guide, you've learned how to securely hash and verify passwords using the Bcrypt algorithm provided by the `drcrypt` library. Secure password handling is a crucial aspect of user authentication and data security.
