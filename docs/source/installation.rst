Installation
============

.. note::
    Before installing MongoFire, you first need to install MongoDB on your machine.
    I'm going to install it on a Linux machine if you're on windows or macOS you can
    install it from here `MongoDB installation <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/#mongodb-installation-tutorials>`_



To install the `drcrypt` library, you can use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install drcrypt
